##Wordpress Starter

Just some barebones files for getting the ball rolling. **Note:** *This is not a designed theme for a wordpress site. Merely a set of files and functions for developing a custom theme.*

### Recommended Developer Plugins

**[Options Framework](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin/)**   
The Options Framework Plugin makes it easy to include an options panel in any WordPress theme. It was built so developers can concentrate on making the actual theme rather than spending time creating an options panel from scratch. It's free to use in both commercial and personal projects, just like WordPress itself.

**[Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/)**   
Plugin that allows you to create custom meta field types for your specific website and access the data in your themes functions. This plugin extends WordPress into another galaxy and should really be a part of core.
